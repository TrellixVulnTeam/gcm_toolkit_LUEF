1) Dialog system
SK: I think it would be a good idea to add a fixed console output system.
I usually use this:
 - [INFO] for everything that is just an information
 - [WARN] for our warnings
 - [STAT] for current status updates (for example progress of long loops)

Would you also like to add this?

RB: Sure, that sounds like a good idea to improve readability!
(While this discussion file was a good opportunity to test my git setup and push
back the answer, maybe we should Github's integrated 'Issue' tab for further
discussion?)
